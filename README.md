# BoilerMakeQR
A simple application to manage qr codes for the BoilerMake hackathon

## About
For BM7, we are striving for a quicker check-in process and a cleaner method to monitor whether or not hackers have received swag or have eaten. To do this, we've opted to use qr codes. This full stack web application aims to offer a means to manage these qr codes while simulaneously offering a way to scan these codes from mobile devices.

## Installation
To run this application, clone the repository and run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
