# HaQR
A modular QR system for event management

## What is this?
HaQR is a QR management system built specifically for the [BoilerMake](https://www.boilermake.org/) hackathon.

Using it, the BoilerMake team is able to use QR codes on our hackers' badges to keep track of what swag and meals they've gotten.
